## What is the best description for my issue ?

To clarify / standardize the declaration a maximum of your issues, we invite you very strongly to follow the pattern below:

__Title :__ `[Component] very short resume of the issue`

> it is important that everyone can understand and know the affected component your issue by reading this sentence

__Body / description :__
```markdown
# Actual behaviour

[Description of the actual behaviour and what is the problem / issue for you]

[Screen shots : if possible, use animated gifs for a better illustration]

# Expected behaviour

[Description of the exprected behaviour]

[if you judge it necessary, add a wireframe]

# Versions

Focus-core: [version]
Focus-components: [version]

```

> GitHub uses "GitHub Flavored Markdown," or GFM, across the site--in issues, comments, and pull requests. It differs from standard Markdown (SM) in a few significant ways, and adds some additional functionality.

# How to make an animated gifs ?

There is a lot of tools on the Internet. The Focus team uses this one : https://screentogif.codeplex.com/
It is free... it is simple... And makes screen shots more understandable and contextualized.

Don't hesitate to use it. 

> Git limitation: the size of the attachments should not exceed 10 MB

# Someone has already declared my issue

This means that someone has also asked the same question, or has already encountered the same problem.

If 
* the issue is still open
* no response has yet been made

you can indicate that you are also waiting for a response. To do so, use the code `:+1:`. This will tell the FOCUS team he must prioritize a response to the request.

If you wish to clarify or complete the outcome, do not hesitate to communicate through comments.
