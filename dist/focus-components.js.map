implicit chaining.\n * Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections, and functions can\n * be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value or may return a\n * primitive value will automatically end the chain returning the unwrapped\n * value. Explicit chaining may be enabled using `_.chain`. The execution of\n * chained methods is lazy, that is, execution is deferred until `_#value`\n * is implicitly or explicitly called.\n *\n * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion. Shortcut\n * fusion is an optimization strategy which merge iteratee calls; this can help\n * to avoid the creation of intermediate data structures and greatly reduce the\n * number of iteratee executions.\n *\n * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n *\n * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n *\n * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `reverse`, `shift`, `slice`, `sort`,\n * `splice`, and `unshift`\n *\n * The wrapper `String` methods are:\n * `replace` and `split`\n *\n * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:\n * `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropRightWhile`, `dropWhile`, `filter`,\n * `first`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `pluck`, `reject`, `rest`, `reverse`,\n * `slice`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, `toArray`,\n * and `where`\n *\n * The chainable wrapper methods are:\n * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `at`, `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`,\n * `callback`, `chain`, `chunk`, `commit`, `compact`, `concat`, `constant`,\n * `countBy`, `create`, `curry`, `debounce`,

`uniq`, `unshift`, `unzip`, `unzipWith`, `values`,\n * `valuesIn`, `where`, `without`, `wrap`, `xor`, `zip`, `zipObject`, `zipWith`\n *\n * The wrapper methods that are **not** chainable by default are:\n * `add`, `attempt`, `camelCase`, `capitalize`, `ceil`, `clone`, `cloneDeep`,\n * `deburr`, `endsWith`, `escape`, `escapeRegExp`, `every`, `find`, `findIndex`,\n * `findKey`, `findLast`,
